class GraniteSwitchConfig(GraniteMoeHybridConfig):
    """Configuration class for GraniteSwitch model.

    Extends the Granite base config with parameters for adapter switching.
    The switch engine is the Kerdock/DG coded-memory MultiSwitch (the only
    engine). Control tokens are handled exclusively via token exchange: the
    switch reads ``input_ids``, decides the active adapter, and rewrites each
    control token to its substitute id (from ``adapter_substitute_token_ids``)
    before the decoder embeds the sequence. The decoder is unaware of the
    substitution.

    Args:
        num_adapters (int): Number of LoRA adapters available. Default: 0 (no adapters).
            This counts real LoRA adapters only (not base). Index 0 always means "base / no adapter".
        adapter_token_ids (List[int]): Token IDs for adapter control.
            Length: num_adapters (one token per real adapter). Must be unique.
            adapter_token_ids[i] activates adapter i+1 (1-indexed output).
            Output 0 = base (implicit default, no token needed to return to base).
        adapter_substitute_token_ids (List[int]): Token IDs whose embeddings
            replace the control-token embeddings before the decoder runs.
            Length: num_adapters (or num_adapters + 1 with a leading base-reset
            token). Required when num_adapters > 0.

        Switch attention parameters:
            control_token_gain (float): Attention gain for control/non-control separation. Default: 15.0.
            switch_head_dim (int): Dimension of Q/K/V vectors in switch attention. Default: 32.

        adapter_names (List[str]): Ordered adapter names for name-to-index mapping.
        max_lora_rank (int): Maximum rank across all LoRA adapters (for allocation). Default: 8.
        adapter_ranks (List[int]): Per-adapter ranks. Must have length equal to num_adapters.
        lora_target_modules (List[str]): List of module GROUP names to apply LoRA to.
            Module groups: "qkv_proj", "o_proj", "shared_input_linear", "shared_output_linear".
            Default: all four groups

        Audio (ASR) preprocessing parameters (see docs/AUDIO.md):
            asr_enabled (bool): Register the audio preprocessor that transcribes
                audio and splices the transcript into the prompt. Default: False.
            asr_model_id (Optional[str]): HF id of the speech-to-text model. None
                falls back to the built-in default (Granite Speech 5.0 TurboCTC,
                a 470M English CTC encoder).
            asr_device (str): Device the ASR model runs on. Default "cuda" — the
                default encoder is small and GPU-bound work is what makes it fast.
                Set "cpu" to keep vLLM's GPU memory budget entirely for KV cache.
            asr_dtype (Optional[str]): Precision the ASR weights load in, one of
                ASR_DTYPES. None/"auto" derives it from asr_device (bfloat16 on
                CUDA, float32 otherwise). bfloat16 because it is the default
                checkpoint's own dtype and keeps float32's exponent range, which
                suits an encoder with BatchNorm layers; float16 still works on the
                default model and can be set explicitly. Default: None.
            asr_pipeline_kwargs (Optional[dict]): Extra kwargs merged into the
                ``transformers.pipeline(...)`` construction, e.g.
                ``{"chunk_length_s": 15}``. Baked into the transcriber cache key.
                Default: None.
            asr_generate_kwargs (Optional[dict]): Default decode-time kwargs, e.g.
                ``{"language": "de"}``. Applied per call, so one pipeline is
                reused; per-request ``mm_processor_kwargs`` override them. Ignored
                by non-generative backends. Default: None.
            asr_max_audio_clips (int): Max audio clips per request. Bounds the
                synchronous transcriptions one request can trigger and the startup
                profiling pass; ``--limit-mm-per-prompt`` may lower it, not raise
                it. Default: 32.
            asr_chunk_length_s (float): Chunker window length in seconds, and so
                also the longest clip that reaches the backend in one piece (a
                shorter clip is a single segment). Only used when asr_self_chunks
                is False. Default: 120.0 — what the default CTC encoder handles in
                one pass before activation memory dominates.
            asr_chunk_overlap_s (float): Overlap in seconds between chunker
                windows, de-duplicated by the transcript merge. Only used when
                asr_self_chunks is False. Default: 5.0.
            asr_self_chunks (bool): True when the backend chunks long audio
                itself (Whisper's timestamp stitching beats our text-level merge),
                bypassing our chunker. False routes audio through the
                split/transcribe/merge chunker instead. Default: False — the
                default CTC backend does not self-chunk, and the HF pipeline's own
                CTC chunking mis-trims seams for it (it needs the model to publish
                inputs_to_logits_ratio, which this checkpoint does not).

        Shadow Residual (SR) parameters:
            dual_stream (bool): Whole-checkpoint decoder mode. ``False`` (default) =
                ordinary LoRA/aLoRA, one stream. ``True`` = Shadow Residual, every
                adapter runs a base stream plus an adapter stream and takes K/V from
                the base stream. A checkpoint holds either SR adapters or
                LoRA/aLoRA adapters, never both, so this is a single flag rather
                than a per-adapter list.
            cross_stream_rank (int): LoRA rank of the layer-level ``cross_stream``
                injection site. Required when ``dual_stream`` is True; must be
                ``None`` otherwise, since the site is not allocated at all.

        SingleSwitch has been removed. A checkpoint built for it cannot run as
        MultiSwitch: MultiSwitch owns ``num_cache_layers == 2`` where SingleSwitch
        owned 1, so a single-sized checkpoint has one decoder layer too few and its
        weights cannot map. There is no auto-migration -- it must be re-composed.

        This is the one seam that still sees the raw on-disk config, so the reject
        lives here. Two shapes identify a SingleSwitch checkpoint (adapters > 0):

        * an explicit ``switch_type`` that is not ``"multi"`` -- a single checkpoint

          composed before the coded engine existed. ``ms_code_m`` is serialized by
          every MultiSwitch checkpoint (it is always set as an instance attribute),
          so its absence is the reliable marker that this predates MultiSwitch.

        A stale ``switch_type`` key on a real MultiSwitch checkpoint is stripped
