# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

**granite-switch** implements **Granite Switch**, a system for building and deploying Granite models with embedded LoRA adapters. The system is a single unified Python package (`granite_switch`) with optional extras for different backends.

1. **Building models with embedded adapters** - Combine a base Granite model with multiple LoRA adapters into a single checkpoint
2. **Automatic adapter control** - Activate adapters via special control tokens or chat templates
3. **Fast inference** - Deploy with vLLM for speedup over standard HuggingFace inference
4. **Optional trainable switching** - Train a router to automatically select adapters per-token

## Import Paths

```python
# Config (shared by all backends)
from granite_switch import GraniteSwitchConfig
from granite_switch.config import GraniteSwitchConfig  # equivalent

# HuggingFace backend
from granite_switch.hf import GraniteSwitchForCausalLM
from granite_switch.hf.core.lora import SwitchedLoRALinear
from granite_switch.hf.switch.single import SingleSwitch

# vLLM backend (auto-registered via plugin entry point)
from granite_switch.vllm import register

# Compose system

```

## File Organization Convention

**IMPORTANT:** Keep the repository organized by placing files in their designated directories.

### Documentation Files (Markdown)

**All `.md` documentation files MUST go in a `docs/` directory:**

- **Root-level docs (`docs/`)**: Cross-implementation documentation, guides, and architecture docs
- **Exceptions**: Only `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` may be at the repository root

### Test Files (Python)

**All `test_*.py` test files MUST go in a `tests/` directory:**

- **`tests/unit/`**: Unit tests (fastest, CPU-only)
- **`tests/hf/`**: HuggingFace implementation tests
- **`tests/vllm/`**: vLLM implementation tests
- **`tests/composer/`**: Compose system tests
- **`tests/integration/`**: Cross-implementation and end-to-end integration tests
- **`tests/regression/`**: Regression tests (hf/, vllm/, integration/, shared/, tools/)
- **`tests/shared/`**: Shared test utilities and parametrized cases

**IMPORTANT: `tests/` is for official regression tests ONLY.** Do NOT place throwaway diagnostic,
debugging, or exploratory scripts in `tests/`. Use `scratch/` instead (it is gitignored). Running
`pytest tests/` should only execute curated, maintained tests — never one-off investigations.

### Naming Conventions

- **Test files**: `test_*.py`
- **Documentation**: `UPPER_CASE.md`
- **Scripts**: `snake_case.py`

## The Doom Demo (`tutorials/scripts/doom/`)

### Its goal

The demo is not about playing Doom. It shows that one language model (one Granite Switch
checkpoint) can do high-quality language-model work and, at the same time, make decisions
fast enough to drive a high-performance environment. Its game adapters choose an action
every tic (35 a second) while its narrator talks about the match, answers the person
watching and takes their orders. Everything in the demo serves that claim:

- **The narration is the evidence.** It is how the audience sees that the model understands
  the game: what he says must be true by the game state, about what is happening, and
  varied. Repetitive, generic or invented lines undercut the claim.
- **Quality comes from the models and their training data,** not from decoding rules or
  runtime filters that hide what the model does (banned words, repetition penalties,
  rewriting its output). Those read as hacks to make the game work, not as the model
  deciding.
- **Calibrated models.** A model's probabilities should mean what they say: an order read
  at p = 0.9 should be right about 90% of the time.
- **Readable.** The code will be released as open source, to be read. Anything that makes
  it hard to see what drives the model's behavior weakens the demo: keep the mechanisms
  few, explicit and in the repo.

### Restriction: the training data must be reconstructible

It must be possible for a person reading the repo to reconstruct all of the training data
from the IVR loop, so that they can modify it if they want. The loop is the writer, its
checks (in code and by the judge) and its repairs, on Mellea: `narrator_data.py` (the
narrator's lines), `narrator_prompts.py` (every word its writer sees), `checks.py` (every
rule a line must pass, and the judge's questions), `orders_data.py`, `router_data.py`,
`rft.py`. It is fed by `collect.py` (the matches) and `talk.py` (the speaking moments).
The recipe is `recipe.sh`, documented in `docs/DOOM_RECIPE.md`.

The data itself may or may not be committed. What the repo must hold is the recipe: the
commands that recreate every dataset an adapter trains on, in order, from the matches to the
composed checkpoint. In practice:

- The recipe lives in the repo: each step's command, its inputs and outputs, and the
  writer and judge models, seeds and settings it uses. Not only in job scripts outside it,
  such as `scratch/`, which is gitignored.
- Every rule that shapes the data lives in the repo's code: writer prompts and moves,
  code checks, judge questions, filters. No hand-edited or out-of-band data.
- A change to the data is a change to that code or to the recipe, never to the data files
  directly.

## Development Commands

### Composing Models

```bash
# Compose with HuggingFace adapters
python -m granite_switch.composer.compose_granite_switch \
  --adapters ibm-granite/granitelib-rag-r1.0

# Multiple adapters
python -m granite_switch.composer.compose_granite_switch \
  --adapters ibm-granite/granitelib-rag-r1.0 your-org/extra-adapter

# Custom output directory
python -m granite_switch.composer.compose_granite_switch \
  --adapters ibm-granite/granitelib-rag-r1.0 --output ./my-custom-model
```

### Cluster: Never Run Work on a Login Node

**Never run anything on a cluster login node.** Every computation, however small or short
(Python scripts, data processing, dataset writers, collection, tests, servers), goes into a
SLURM job (`sbatch`, submitted from login2), CPU or GPU. Login nodes are shared by everyone:
many processes there slow the node for all users and can make it unreachable. A login node is
only for submitting and monitoring jobs, the tmux sessions that hold them, and reading files.

### Testing

**Always use `-v -s --tb=short`** when running tests. `-v` (verbose) prints each test name as
it starts, giving real-time progress visibility. `-s` disables output capture so `print()`
statements inside tests appear immediately instead of being swallowed. Without these, long-running
test files produce no output until they finish. `-x` (fail fast) stops on the first failure —
no point running 200 more tests after something breaks.

**Check GPU availability first** — the underlying hardware can change between sessions:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print('GPU' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CPU only')"
```

This determines which tests can run. vLLM and integration tests require a GPU; unit and HF tests
run on CPU.

**Run tests incrementally by directory**, in order of speed — don't run the full suite as a
single command:

```bash
# 1. Unit tests first (fastest, CPU)
pytest tests/unit/ -v -s --tb=short -x

# 2. HF tests by file (CPU)
pytest tests/hf/test_single_switch.py -v -s --tb=short -x
pytest tests/hf/test_model_forward.py -v -s --tb=short -x

# 3. vLLM tests by file (GPU required)
pytest tests/vllm/test_single_switch.py -v -s --tb=short -x
pytest tests/vllm/test_model_forward.py -v -s --tb=short -x

# 4. Integration tests last (slowest, GPU required)
pytest tests/integration/ -v -s --tb=short -x

# Run a specific test pattern when debugging
pytest tests/ -k "pattern" -v -s --tb=short -x
```

### vLLM Deployment

```bash
# Verify plugin registration
python -c "from vllm.plugins import load_general_plugins; \
           from vllm import ModelRegistry; \
           load_general_plugins(); \
           print('OK' if 'GraniteSwitchForCausalLM' in ModelRegistry.get_supported_archs() else 'FAIL')"

# Start API server
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
  --model ./granite-with-all-aloras \
  --port 8000
```

## Architecture

### Granite Switch Model

The Granite Switch extends the base Granite model with:

1. **Embedded LoRA Adapters** (frozen during inference)
   - Multiple task/domain-specific adapters embedded in the same checkpoint
   - Each adapter has LoRA weights (lora_A, lora_B) stacked in tensors
   - Controlled via special tokens or router-selected indices

2. **Control Tokens**
   - Each adapter has a control token `<|adapter|>` that fires the switch
   - KV hiding uses group-based control dimensions (K=finfo.min, Q=per-adapter policy)
   - Control tokens are KV-hidden to prevent cross-request interference

3. **Chat Template Integration**
   - Maps adapter names to control tokens
   - Automatic token placement based on adapter type (ALORA vs LORA)

4. **Optional Trainable Router** (SingleSwitch)
   - N transformer layers that compute adapter indices per-token
   - Linear projection head to num_adapters dimensions
   - ~1-2% of total model parameters

### Two Backends

#### HuggingFace Backend (`granite_switch.hf`)

**Purpose**: Model building and optional router training

- Full `transformers` integration (`PreTrainedModel`, `GenerationMixin`)
- Training with `Trainer` API
- Standard PyTorch operations

#### vLLM Backend (`granite_switch.vllm`)

**Purpose**: Fast production inference (10-20x speedup)

- SWITCH fused-LoRA Triton kernel for optimized adapter computation (replaces Punica)
- PagedAttention for efficient KV cache
- Continuous batching, tensor/pipeline parallelism
- OpenAI-compatible API server

### Shadow Residual (SR) Dual-Stream

SR runs a frozen base stream and a LoRA adapter stream through the same layer, connected by a
`cross_stream` low-rank injection. The two streams share every parameter (the base stream is
the same modules called with `adapter_indices=None`), and K/V always come from the base
stream. SR uses the same fused projections as the rest of the HF backend.

One `GraniteSwitchModel` / `GraniteSwitchForCausalLM` pair serves both modes and picks its
decoder layer class in `__init__` from `config.dual_stream`: `SRSwitchDecoderLayer` (a
subclass) when True, `GraniteSwitchAttentionDecoderLayer` otherwise. A checkpoint holds
**either** SR adapters **or** standard LoRA/aLoRA adapters — the composer rejects a mixed
set. See [docs/SR_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/SR_ARCHITECTURE.md) for full details.

### Weight Compatibility

Both backends share the same weight format:

```python
# Built/trained with HuggingFace
model_hf.save_pretrained("./checkpoint")

# Loaded directly with vLLM
llm = LLM(model="./checkpoint")
```

## Key Configuration Parameters

### Granite-Specific Parameters

- **`attention_multiplier`**: Attention score scaling (instead of `1/sqrt(head_dim)`)
- **`logits_scaling`**: Applied to final logits (main architectural difference with Llama)
- **`residual_multiplier`**: Applied to residual connections
- **`embedding_multiplier`**: Applied to input embeddings

Always use config values - never hardcode these parameters.

### Switch Configuration

```json
{
  "model_type": "granite_switch",
  "architectures": ["GraniteSwitchForCausalLM"],
  "num_adapters": 4,
  "adapter_token_ids": [100, 101, 102, 103],
  "adapter_names": ["adapter_0", "adapter_1", "adapter_2", "adapter_3"],
  "hiding_groups": {"all_controls": ["adapter_0", "adapter_1", "adapter_2", "adapter_3"]},
  "hiding_policy": {"base": ["all_controls"], "adapter_0": ["all_controls"], "...": "..."},
  "lora_rank": 8,
  "lora_alpha": 8.0,
  "switch_head_dim": 32,
  "control_dims": 32
}
```

## Common Gotchas

### 1. Adapter Index Convention

**Control tokens**: `0` = no adapter, `1+` = adapter indices

**SWITCH kernel (vLLM)**: per-module *kernel-local* indices — `0` = base (no adapter, or not applicable to this module), `1..` = that module's applicable adapters in ascending rank order. Global adapter ids are remapped per module centrally (see `vllm/core/lora_kernel_meta.py`).

### 2. Control Token Generatability

All control tokens are freely generatable — there is no runtime suppression. The
model can produce any control token during generation.

### 3. Chat Template Token Placement

- **ALORA adapters**: Token placed either in user message by matching invocation sequence or right before generation prompt
- **LORA adapters**: Token placed at sequence beginning

### 3a. Dual Chat-Template Formats

Two Granite chat-template families are supported, auto-detected by
`detect_template_format` from the base tokenizer's template: the
`<|start_of_role|>…<|end_of_role|>` role-marker format (4.0/4.1) and the ChatML
`<|im_start|>…<|im_end|>` format (4.2). All adapter control-token injection is
driven by the detected `TemplateFormat` rather than hardcoded per format.

### 4. Granite vs Llama Differences

- Granite uses `logits_scaling` (typically 8.0)
- Custom attention scaling via `attention_multiplier`
- Different residual and embedding multipliers

Always load from config, never hardcode.

### 5. End-to-End Tests Must Use Compose Infrastructure

No test should manually assemble `GraniteSwitchConfig` or call `transfer_base_weights`
directly.  All model construction must go through `GraniteSwitchComposer` so that the
compose pipeline itself is what's being tested.  If the composer can't handle a use case
(e.g., zero-adapter skinning), extend the composer — don't work around it in tests.

### 6. HF Attention Backends and Causal Masking

The eager backend does NOT handle `attention_mask=None` as causal — it treats `None` as no mask
(full attention). SDPA and FlashAttention handle `attention_mask=None` correctly via `is_causal`
attribute on the module.

The HF stress tests (`tests/hf/test_single_switch.py`) auto-detect which attention backends work on the
current platform by probing each with a k=-inf GQA call at import time. Unavailable backends are skipped.

### 7. Known Limitation: Hidden Count Offset When Position 0 is in a Hiding Group

When position 0 is a control token in a hiding group (e.g., a LoRA prefix token with
`add_bos_token=False`), `hidden_count` is off by 1, causing a 1-position RoPE offset. This is
acceptable because adapter detection is exact and RoPE is robust to small positional shifts.

### 8. Known Limitation: TP Row-Parallel Bias Doubling

`SwitchedLoRALinear`'s row-parallel bypass path passes bias to all TP ranks instead of
suppressing it for rank > 0. After all-reduce this doubles the bias. Not affected: all Granite
architectures (4.0, 4.1) use `attention_bias=False` and `mlp_bias=False`.

### 9. Backends Use Fused Projections (Not Bit-Exact with Upstream)

The GraniteSwitch HF backend uses fused QKV and gate-up projections, symmetric with the vLLM
backend architecture. Upstream HuggingFace `GraniteMoeHybridForCausalLM` uses separate projections.
Fused projections change the floating-point reduction order, so bit-exact skinning equivalence
with the upstream HF model is not achievable. The HF skinning tests in
`tests/composer/test_skinning_equivalence.py` are skipped for this reason.

The vLLM check (`tests/vllm/test_generation_equivalence.py`) is the authoritative equivalence
test, but it is **not** token-exact either. The skinned model runs its projections through the
fused SWITCH Triton kernel (`kernels/switch_lora_kernel.py`), whose float-reduction order differs
from vLLM's native linear even with a zero adapter, so the two paths are numerically close but not
bit-identical. That sub-ULP difference can flip a near-tie greedy argmax — observed under vLLM 0.20
but not 0.19, because each version's numerics land the tie on a different side. The test therefore
gates **distribution equivalence** (per-position top-k JSD + Jaccard), not token-for-token match:
robust to benign ties while still catching a real logit/weight regression. See
`tests/vllm/_generation_equivalence_worker.py` for the metric and thresholds.

### 10. Known Limitation: bf16 Caps the vLLM MultiSwitch Counting Head at 188 Control Tokens

The coded engine recovers a control token's write address from a `1/(1+n)` attention signal.
The HF backend forces that signal to fp32 and is exact past 4095; the vLLM backend's heads are
paged-KV `vllm.Attention` modules, so the signal takes the KV-cache dtype and bf16 inverts
exactly only up to `n = 188` (189 aliases). This is a different limit from the codebook's
`capacity == 2048`, which bounds the memory head, not the counting head. Handled only in
`Conversation`, and by fallback rather than refusal: above `MAX_RETAINED_CONTROL_TOKENS = 188` it
re-prefills the turn, resetting the count to one and losing history's adapter attribution (logged;
counted in `Conversation.reprefills`). A raw `/v1/completions` request still bypasses this entirely.
`--kv-cache-dtype fp8` is also unguarded and would saturate `_NEG_INF` and `code(n) * 28`.
See section 8 of [docs/MULTISWITCH_EXPLAINED.md](docs/MULTISWITCH_EXPLAINED.md).

### 11. `MultiSwitch`'s Debug Attributes Exist Only Under `enforce_eager`

`_debug_write_addresses` and `_debug_counting_signal` are written behind
`if not torch.compiler.is_compiling():` (`src/granite_switch/vllm/switch/multi.py`), and the switch
runs inside the `@support_torch_compile` region (`src/granite_switch/vllm/granite_switch_model.py`).
`is_compiling()` is True during tracing, so the body is absent from the compiled graph — a
default-configured server never sets them. Any test reading them must pass `enforce_eager=True` and
must assert they are present, not skip on `None`. The same reason is why a host-side validation check
cannot live in `MultiSwitch.forward`.
### 12. Pre-Fusion SR Checkpoints Must Be Re-Composed

SR used to build unfused Q/K/V and gate/up/down projections (`unfused_qkv=True`); it now uses
the same fused projections as everything else. Since `transformers` silently keeps unknown
config keys, an old unfused checkpoint would otherwise load into a fused model and quietly
mismatch keys, so `GraniteSwitchConfig` rejects `unfused_qkv=True` with a re-compose error.
See [docs/SR_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/SR_ARCHITECTURE.md) for details.

### 13. `shared_intermediate_size == 0` Means Skip the Shared MLP, Not Build a Zero-Width One

A pure sparse-MoE base (`granitemoe`) has no dense shared MLP; upstream encodes this as
`shared_intermediate_size == 0`. `GraniteMoeSharedMLP.__init__` sets `self.hidden_size =
config.shared_intermediate_size`, so constructing it at 0 would register `[0, H]`/`[H, 0]` weights
that no checkpoint ships and then add their output into the MoE result. All three decoders (`hf`,
`vllm/decoder/lora`, `vllm/decoder/shadow_residual`) therefore gate on `shared_intermediate_size >
0`, set `shared_mlp = None` otherwise, and `config.py` correspondingly drops the
`shared_input_linear`/`shared_output_linear` LoRA targets so no zero-width LoRA is built either.
A layer with neither experts nor a shared MLP is invalid: the three decoders raise `ValueError`,
but **the config itself does not** — the guard is decoder-level. This is why the vLLM-LoRA forward's
`not has_experts → shared_mlp(x)` branch is safe only because that `ValueError` upstream rules out
the no-MLP case; protect it if you refactor the gate. Config-level coverage:
`tests/unit/test_config_edge_cases.py`.

## Pre-commit

**See [docs/CICD.md](docs/CICD.md) for the full CI/CD setup — pre-commit hook list, setup steps, and what runs on every commit vs. in CI.**

This repo uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) (ruff, hygiene hooks, SPDX-header and DCO-signoff checks, and a local link validator) to enforce quality before a commit lands. Hooks run automatically on `git commit` and most are auto-fixing, so re-stage and commit again if a hook modifies files. Do NOT use `--no-verify` to bypass — fix the underlying issue instead.

**Quick reference:**

- **Branch naming**: `feature/ticket-ID-description` or `bugfix/ticket-ID-description`
- **Workflow**: Branch from `main` → develop → rebase → PR → merge → delete branch
- **Critical**: Always verify comments match code before committing (see GIT_WORKFLOW.md)
- **Commit format**: Clear summary + explanation of WHAT changed and WHY

When committing, **never sign as Claude** (per project instructions)
