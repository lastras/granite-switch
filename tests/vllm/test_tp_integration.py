"""TP integration tests — require 2+ GPUs with vLLM installed.

Verifies the TP plumbing in SwitchedLoRALinear is structurally correct by
loading a Granite Switch model at TP=1 and TP=2 and checking that the
first-generated-token logprob distribution agrees within bf16 numerical
tolerance. We do NOT assert byte-equality of generated text; see the comment
above TOPK_OVERLAP_MIN for why that is not a well-defined invariant.

Each step (build, run@TP=1, run@TP=2) runs in a separate subprocess to avoid
CUDA fork issues — follows the same pattern as test_generation_equivalence.py.

Test cases:
  1. granite-4.0-micro with real adapters from ibm-granite/granitelib-rag-r1.0

Skip automatically if fewer than 2 GPUs or vLLM is not installed.

# Tolerances for TP=1 vs TP=2 equivalence check.

# We compare the first-generated-token logprob distribution, not the greedy
# text, because byte-equality of greedy decoding is not an invariant in bf16:
# TP>1 reorders all-reduce summations, which flips low-bit rounding, which
# (after 40 layers of compounding) can flip near-tie argmaxes on the rare
# prompt that lands on such a tie. See docs/TENSOR_PARALLEL_FIX.md.
#
# What we DO want to catch: structural bugs — wrong sharding, missing
# all-reduce, bias applied on wrong rank, etc. — which would cause
# order-of-magnitude drifts, not 1 ULP.
#
# - TOPK_OVERLAP_MIN: how many of the top-K tokens must be the same set.
#   For K=20 a structural bug would scramble the list; fp noise only shuffles
#   a handful of near-ties.
# - TOP1_LOGPROB_ATOL: absolute tolerance on the top-1 token's logprob.
#   Observed bf16 noise at final_norm_out was ~4 in hidden-state units, which
#   after logits_scaling=8 and a softmax can produce ~1.0 logprob drift on
#   near-ties. 2.0 is comfortably above noise and well below any real bug.
