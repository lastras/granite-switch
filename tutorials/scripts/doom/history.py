"""Compact game history for the prompt: 5 Hz entries, append-only token ids.

Every adapter reads the same prompt up to its query suffix::

    [system] [history: one entry per 0.2 s, last <= 10 s] [now + current state] <|adapter|>...

The history is base-model text that only grows, so from one tic to the next the
engine's prefix cache holds all of it and the only fresh tokens are the current
state and the suffix. Entries therefore carry absolute match time (``t12.4``,
seconds) rather than an age that would change every tic; the current-state line
starts with ``now t14.2`` so the model can tell how old each entry is.

An entry summarizes the 0.2 s that just ended::

    t12.4 hp 64 face 135 | bot +10 8m, bot -40 20m | did cl | frag

``face`` is the player's heading in whole degrees (the player knows how far it
has turned), so bearings in older entries can be related to the current view.
``did`` is the most frequent action of the span, events (frag, died, respawn,
got health, ...) are appended.

**Window.** The history grows to ``window_s`` seconds, then the oldest half is
dropped. That one tic changes the prompt from the first history token on, so the
engine prefills the kept half again (about 600 tokens); every other tic is
append-only. :attr:`History.resets` counts these.

Each entry is tokenized on its own and the ids are concatenated. Entries start
right after a newline and end with one, so this equals tokenizing the joined
text (``python history.py`` checks it on real play).
