"""Write a narrator's training lines with Mellea's instruct-validate-repair loop.

A thinking model (Granite 4.2 30B, served by vLLM's OpenAI-compatible server)
writes one spoken line per speaking moment of a recorded match (``talk.py
moments``), in order within the match, so it sees what it already said. Each line
must pass checks in code (length, openings, PG-13, not a known film line, not a
near-repeat of the match's recent lines) and checks the same model judges with
thinking off (reacts to this moment; in the voice; witty). A failed check's
reason goes back to the writer, which repairs its line (MultiTurnStrategy).

Runs in an environment with Mellea (``pip install mellea``), not the demo's::

    python narrate_ivr.py --moments data/narr/moments.jsonl --out data/narr/crime.jsonl \\
        --base-url http://HOST:PORT/v1 --model granite-4.2-30b

``--judge`` scores lines written elsewhere (a trained narrator's, the base
model's) with the same checks, once, without repair::

    python narrate_ivr.py --judge runs/narr/narrator/heldout_gen.jsonl \\
        --out runs/narr/narrator/judged.jsonl --base-url http://HOST:PORT/v1
