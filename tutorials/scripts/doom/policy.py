"""Policies for the Doom demo, plus direct prompt-id assembly.

Every policy answers ``decide(obs, adapter, history) -> Decision``,
``decide_many(obs, adapters, history)`` (several adapters on one state, one
engine step) and ``route(instruction) -> Route``, so rollouts, the latency bench
and the live server can use any of them:

* :class:`ExpertPolicy`: the scripted player, its weapon planner, a rule-based
  danger estimate and a keyword router. Needs no model, so the whole demo runs
  on a laptop.
* :class:`VLLMPolicy`: the composed Granite Switch checkpoint served in-process
  by vLLM. One engine step per tic prefills the fresh tokens and emits one
  token per adapter asked.

The game prompt, identical for every game adapter up to its query suffix::

    <|start_of_role|>system<|end_of_role|>{system}<|end_of_text|>
    <|start_of_role|>user<|end_of_role|>{history}{pad}now t14.2 | {state}{pad}<|end_of_text|>
    <|adapter|>assistant<|end_of_role|>            -> one output token

``{history}`` is :class:`history.History`: append-only 5 Hz entries, so the
engine's prefix cache holds it from one tic to the next. ``{pad}`` is newlines
up to the next KV block boundary (``BLOCK`` tokens). The first pad changes only
when the history grows (every 0.2 s); the second makes the state end on a block
boundary. Together they leave only the adapter suffix as per-adapter work when
several adapters read the same state in one step.

A checkpoint composed from **LoRA** adapters (the baseline that aLoRA is
compared against) puts the control token at position 0 instead, in place of the
first ``<|start_of_role|>``, as the composed chat template does. Every adapter
then has its own KV from the first token on, and nothing is shared. A **Shadow
Residual** checkpoint puts it last: it replaces the final ``<|end_of_role|>``,
so the adapter stream runs on that one position and reads only base K/V.

The narrator's prompt is a conversation of its own, with no game log, in the
OpenAI message format with the game as a tool (:mod:`conversation`)::

    <|start_of_role|>system<|end_of_role|>{NARRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT} ... <tools>...<|end_of_text|>
    <|start_of_role|>user<|end_of_role|>who got you<|end_of_text|>
    <|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|><tool_call>
    {"name": "get_game_state", "arguments": {}}
    </tool_call><|end_of_text|>
    <|start_of_role|>user<|end_of_role|>
    <tool_response>
    {"time": "2:31", "events": [...]}
    </tool_response><|end_of_text|>
    <|start_of_role|>assistant<|end_of_role|>Rambo. Twice now.<|end_of_text|>
       ... the last exchanges, then the call now and the whole state ...
    <|narrator|>assistant<|end_of_role|>            -> his line

Game prompt ids are assembled directly each tick, which skips Jinja rendering;
the narrator's, rare, are rendered by the chat template itself
(:func:`conversation.narrator_ids`). ``python policy.py --check-template
<model_dir>`` confirms the game ids are identical to
``apply_chat_template(adapter_name=...)`` (without the block padding, which has
no chat-template form), and that the narrator's control token changes nothing
in his prompt but its last header.

        engine_loop: Drive ``LLMEngine.add_request/step`` directly instead of
            ``LLM.generate``.
        prefix_caching: Keep on: the system prompt and the history are then
            prefilled once.
        align: Pad history and state to KV block boundaries (see module doc).
        logprobs_mode: ``processed_logprobs`` so the probabilities are over the
            allowed outputs, renormalized.
        cudagraph_mode: ``FULL`` captures the whole forward, SWITCH kernels
            included, for prefill steps too; ``FULL_AND_PIECEWISE`` is vLLM's
            default.
        gc_freeze: After warmup, move every live object to the permanent
            generation so a full GC pass does not walk vLLM's object heap in the
            middle of a decision.
        async_scheduling: Passed to vLLM when set; ``None`` keeps its default.
        base_model: ``model`` is a plain base checkpoint without control tokens;
            every adapter then maps to the base prompt (the SWITCH-overhead
            baseline).
        temperature: Sampling temperature for the style adapters and the
            weapon planner (0 = greedy). Students of a stochastic RL teacher
            play better sampling, as the teacher does; the critic and router
            stay greedy.
        attention: vLLM ``attention_config``. ``None`` picks FlashAttention 2
            for a Shadow Residual checkpoint: its attention is one layer with
            twice the model's query heads, and FlashAttention 3's
            ahead-of-time schedule is sized from the model's head count, so
            under vLLM 0.19.1 it raises in eager mode and returns wrong
            outputs under CUDA graphs.
        layout: ``log`` (one user turn: history, state) or ``chat`` (real
            turns: the player's spoken lines are assistant turns). Must match
            the layout the adapters were trained on.
